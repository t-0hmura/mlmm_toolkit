# Charge and multiplicity (charge-multiplicity.md)

Sometimes a failure of the form "the optimizer ran but the chemistry is
wrong" traces back to a wrong total charge or multiplicity. `mlmm-toolkit`
needs both as integers; getting them right is **non-negotiable** for
meaningful energies.

## Multiplicity (`-m`)

| Default | Use case |
|---|---|
| **1 (singlet, closed shell)** | The default for almost every organic / biological / metal-coordination system whose textbook description is closed-shell. |
| 2 (doublet) | Radical species, unpaired-electron transition states (e.g. radical SAM enzymes, Fe(III) low-spin) |
| 3 (triplet) | O₂, some carbenes, ferromagnetic Mn(IV)–Mn(IV) couples in low-symmetry environments |
| 4 (quartet) | Mn(II) / Fe(III) high-spin in some geometries |
| 5 (quintet) | Mn(III), Fe(II) high-spin |
| 6 (sextet) | Mn(II) high-spin, S=5/2 ferric |

> **Default to `-m 1` unless you have a positive reason to disagree.**
> If the system contains a known paramagnetic metal, look up the
> oxidation state and use the high-spin/low-spin assignment from the
> primary literature for that enzyme.

## Charge (`-q`, or summed via `-l 'RES:Q'`)

**For PDB inputs, prefer `-l`**: give only the non-standard-residue charges
and let the **ML-region** total charge be auto-derived (standard AAs from the
internal table + ions + your ligand charges; waters / link atoms are neutral).
It matches the extraction's reported ML-region charge and stays correct when
the ML region changes — so you never hand-enter the charge. Reserve `-q` for
`.xyz` / `.gjf` inputs (no residues to sum) or to deliberately override.

1. **Per-residue mapping (recommended for PDB)** — pass `-l 'RES1:Q1,RES2:Q2,...'`
   and let `mlmm-toolkit` sum amino-acid + ligand charges over the ML region.
2. **Direct total / override** — pass `-q INTEGER` if you already know the
   total charge of the ML region (or to override the `-l` derivation).

The amino-acid table is internal:

```bash
python -c "from mlmm.workflows.extract import AMINO_ACIDS as a; print(a)"  # Dict[str, int] of canonical residue charges
```

(Or read `mlmm/workflows/extract.py` directly if `dir()` shows other
relevant attributes.)

For non-standard residues / ligands / metals, you must supply `-l`.

## Lookup workflow for an unfamiliar substrate

When you don't know a ligand's formal charge:

### Step 1 — check the primary paper

Most enzyme-mechanism papers state the charge state of the substrate
explicitly in the Methods. The PDB Bank summary page links to the
reference; check there first.

### Step 2 — PubChem / ChEBI

For small-molecule ligands:

- **PubChem** (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) — search by ligand
  3-letter code or name. The "Computed Properties" panel lists
  `Formal Charge`.
- **ChEBI** (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi) — biological compound focus,
  often has the charge state used in published mechanisms.
- **PDB Ligand summary** (e.g. `https://www.rcsb.org/ligand/SAM`) —
  shows the canonical SMILES and charge in the deposited model.

### Step 3 — derive from the SMILES

Given a SMILES (e.g. from PubChem), compute the formal charge:

```python
from rdkit import Chem
mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles("CC(=O)[O-]")     # acetate
print(sum(a.GetFormalCharge() for a in mol.GetAtoms()))    # → -1
```

### Step 4 — protonation state at physiological pH

Many ligands have multiple protonation states. Common rule of thumb:

| Group | At pH 7 | Typical formal charge contribution |
|---|---|---|
| Carboxylate (`-COO⁻`) | deprotonated | −1 each |
| Phosphate, monoester | mostly `-OPO₃²⁻` | −2 |
| Phosphate, diester | mostly `-OPO₂⁻` | −1 |
| Triphosphate (e.g. ATP) | fully deprotonated | −4 |
| Sulfonium (e.g. SAM cofactor) | quaternary | +1 |
| Lysine / Arginine side chain | protonated | +1 |
| Aspartate / Glutamate side chain | deprotonated | −1 |
| Histidine | mostly neutral, possibly +1 | 0 or +1 |

Check the literature for the cluster you are modeling — biological
mechanisms sometimes invoke an unusual protonation state.

### Step 5 — sanity-check the total

After summing residue + ligand + metal charges, sanity-check by:

- Letting `mlmm-toolkit` echo the charge it parsed:

  ```bash
  mlmm extract -i complex.pdb -c '...' -l '...' -o cluster.pdb --out-json
  python -c "import json; print(json.load(open('result.json'))['total_charge'])"
  ```

  `--out-json` writes `result.json` next to the output PDB; it records
  `total_charge` plus a per-source breakdown (`protein_charge`,
  `ligand_total_charge`, `ion_total_charge`). The `--verbose` INFO logs
  (on by default) also print the same charge summary.

- Or run a tiny optimization and read `summary.json`:

  ```bash
  mlmm opt -i cluster.pdb --parm real.parm7 -q ... -m 1 -o /tmp/check --out-json
  python -c "import json; print(json.load(open('/tmp/check/result.json'))['charge'])"
  ```

## Permission to web-search

When the agent does not know a charge / multiplicity:

- **Confirm with the user before running a web search.** Many users
  prefer to point to the relevant paper themselves.
- If web search is allowed, prefer authoritative sources in this order:
  primary research paper → PubChem / ChEBI → general databases →
  general web. Cite the source in the agent's output.
- If neither user input nor a clean web source is available, **stop
  and ask** — do not silently default to `-q 0 -m 1` for a metal
  cluster.

## Quick-reference ligand charges (commonly seen)

Always confirm against the relevant mechanism.

| ADP | `ADP` | −3 |
| GTP | `GTP` | −4 |
| NADH | `NAI`/`NDH` | −2 |
| NAD⁺ | `NAD` | −1 |
| FAD | `FAD` | −2 |

| Heme (Fe(III) protoporphyrin) | `HEM` | +1 (with Fe³⁺ + porphyrin²⁻) |
| Phosphate ion (free) | `PO4` | −2 to −3 |

|---|---|---|
| Mn²⁺ (d⁵) | 5/2 | 6 |
| Fe²⁺ (d⁶), high-spin tetrahedral / weak field | 2 | 5 |
| Fe²⁺ (d⁶), low-spin octahedral / strong field | 0 | 1 |
| Fe³⁺ (d⁵) high-spin | 5/2 | 6 |
| Co²⁺ (d⁷) high-spin | 3/2 | 4 |
| Cu²⁺ (d⁹) | 1/2 | 2 |
| Zn²⁺ (d¹⁰) | 0 | 1 |
