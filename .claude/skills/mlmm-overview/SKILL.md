# mlmm-toolkit Overview

## What it is

`mlmm-toolkit` is a command-line toolkit for ML/MM ONIOM workflows on
solvated enzyme systems. It chains active-site definition, ML region
optimization with MM-environment relaxation, MEP search, TS
optimization, IRC validation, vibrational analysis, and an optional
DFT single-point — all driven by the same MLIP backends as
`pdb2reaction` plus an MM force-field layer.

The design choices that make it distinct:

1. **3-layer ONIOM via PDB B-factor encoding.** The B-factor field
   classifies every atom into ML (0.0), movable-MM (10.0), or frozen
   (20.0). One PDB → one defined system, no separate topology files
   for the partitioning.
2. **`hessian_ff` analytical Hessian for MM.** Custom analytical
   Hessian for the MM force field (instead of finite-difference),
   used both in microiteration and in the ML/MM-coupled freq step.
3. **Microiteration outer/inner loop.** ML region geometry update
   alternates with MM relaxation; outer ML steps see a relaxed MM
   environment.
4. **Bundled GPU pysisyphus fork (same as `pdb2reaction`).**
   Geometry / TS / IRC stay on the same device as the MLIP.
5. **AmberTools-driven MM parameterization.** `mlmm mm-parm` builds
   `parm7`/`rst7` from a PDB; `define-layer` assigns the ML / movable
   / frozen labels.

## When to use it

| Goal | Fit |
|---|---|
| Solvated enzyme reaction with explicit MM environment | Primary use case |
| Cluster model only (no MM region) | Use `pdb2reaction` instead |
| Need link-atom + microiteration coupling | This toolkit |
| Need recursive multistep path search | Both share the same `path-search` engine |
| Reuse a Gaussian g16 ONIOM input | `mlmm oniom-import` (then run downstream stages) |

## When *not* to use it

- Pure QM (DFT-only) cluster: `pdb2reaction dft` or a direct ORCA /
  Gaussian / Q-Chem workflow.
- Free-energy simulations (umbrella sampling, metadynamics): out of
  scope.
- ML-only enzyme reaction, no MM: `pdb2reaction` is leaner.

## Quick check

```bash
mlmm --version
mlmm --help              # 22 subcommands listed
mlmm all --help          # end-to-end pipeline
```

If `mlmm` is not on PATH or imports fail, see
`mlmm-install-backends/SKILL.md`.

## Pipeline at a glance

```
PDB(s)          (with B-factor: 0.0=ML, 10.0=movable-MM, 20.0=frozen)
  │
  ▼
[mm-parm]       AmberTools tleap → parm7 / rst7
  │
  ▼
[define-layer]  expand / refine / verify the ML/MM/Frozen labels
  │
  ▼
[path-search]   recursive MEP, ONIOM gradients (ML + MM coupling)
  │
  ▼
[tsopt]         TS refinement per segment
  │
  ▼
[irc]           forward/backward IRC + endpoint LBFGS
  │
  ▼
[freq]          analytical-Hessian ONIOM frequencies + QRRHO thermo
  │
  ▼
[dft]           (optional) single-point DFT on ML region only
```

Each step is also available as its own subcommand. `mlmm all` chains
the whole pipeline.

## Backend choices

Same MLIP family as `pdb2reaction`:

| `-b` | Model | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `uma` (default) | UMA-s-1.1, UMA-m-1.1 | Default for ML region |
| `mace` | MACE-OMOL-0 | Separate env (e3nn conflict) |
| `orb` | Orb-v3-omol | Fast screening |
| `aimnet2` | AIMNet2 | Limited element coverage |

MM backend is fixed: `hessian_ff` (CPU only, with analytical Hessian).
DFT (optional) uses PySCF / GPU4PySCF.

## Sibling project: pdb2reaction

`pdb2reaction` shares the same MLIP backends, `pysisyphus` fork, and
`thermoanalysis` core but targets **cluster models** (no MM region).

| Use case | Toolkit |
|---|---|
| Cluster, no MM | `pdb2reaction` |
| Solvated enzyme with MM around ML | `mlmm-toolkit` |
| Need automatic Amber parameterization | `mlmm mm-parm` |
| Recursive multistep path search | Both |

The two toolkits **cannot share a Python environment** (incompatible
`pysisyphus` forks and `e3nn` versions). Keep separate `conda env`s.
